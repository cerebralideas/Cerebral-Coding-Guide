## All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.

### The following list outlines the practices that I use in all code that I am the original author of; contributions to projects that I have created should follow these guidelines.

### I do not intend to impose my style preferences on other people's code; if they have an existing common style - this should be respected.

> "Part of being a good steward to a successful project is realizing that writing code for yourself is a Bad Idea™. If thousands of people are using your code, then write your code for maximum clarity, not your personal preference of how to get clever within the spec." - Idan Gazit

### Get Smart

The following should be considered 1) incomplete, and 2) *REQUIRED READING*. I don't always agree with the style written by the authors below, but one thing is certain: They are consistent. Furthermore, these are authorities on the language.

### Build & Deployment Process

Projects should always attempt to include some generic means by which source can be linted, tested and compressed in preparation for production use. For this task, [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) by Ben Alman is second to none and has officially replaced the "kits/" directory of this repo.




### Test Facility

Projects _must_ include some form of unit, reference, implementation or functional testing. Use case demos DO NOT QUALIFY as "tests". The following is a list of test frameworks, none of which are endorsed more than the other.

 * [QUnit](http://github.com/jquery/qunit)
 * [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine)
 * [Vows](https://github.com/cloudhead/vows)
 * [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha)

## Preface

The following sections outline a _reasonable_ style guide for modern JavaScript development and are not meant to be prescriptive. The most important take-away is the **law of code style consistency**. Whatever you chose as the style for your project should be considered law. Link to this document as a statement of your project's commitment to code style consistency, readability and maintainability.
